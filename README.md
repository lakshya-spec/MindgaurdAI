# 🧠 MindGuard AI

> An on-device AI powered mental wellness companion that analyzes emotions locally, protects user privacy, and helps users reflect through journaling, happy memories, and reminders.

# 📖 Problem Statement

Many mental health applications rely on cloud-based AI services, requiring users to upload deeply personal journal entries and emotions to remote servers. This raises concerns about:

- Privacy
- Data security
- Internet dependency
- High inference costs
- Slow response times

Users deserve an AI companion that keeps their thoughts completely private.

---

# 💡 Solution

MindGuard AI is a browser-based mental wellness application that performs **emotion analysis entirely on the user's device** using Transformers.js.

No journal entries are sent to any external AI service.

The application helps users:

- Write personal journals
- Detect emotions locally
- Receive wellness suggestions
- Save positive memories
- Revisit happy moments
- Manage reminders
- Store everything securely using IndexedDB
